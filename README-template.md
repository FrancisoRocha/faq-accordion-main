## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I struggled a bit with JavaScript, especially in implementing the accordion functionality. However, I learned a lot about event listeners and DOM manipulation in the process.

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on JavaScript, particularly on mastering concepts like event delegation and working with the DOM. Additionally, I want to explore more advanced CSS techniques to enhance the styling of my projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This is my go-to resource for JavaScript documentation and tutorials. It helped me understand many of the concepts I struggled with during this project.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website provides a wealth of information on CSS, including tutorials and articles on advanced techniques. I found it helpful for improving my CSS skills.
